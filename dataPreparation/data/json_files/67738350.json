But that is not the equivalent of <code>\\s</code> in typical regex libraries, which will match any single-byte whitespace character, including tabs and newlines. Flex does not recognise escape sequences like <code>\\s</code>, <code>\\d</code>, or<code>\\w</code>, which might work in regex packages.</p>\n<p>Flex does have two built-in sets which you can use inside a character class. (Note that &quot;inside a character class&quot; implies that you need to surround these with additional <code>[\u2026]</code>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[:space:]</code> means exactly what <code>\\s</code> would mean: any whitespace character, horizontal or vertical.</li>\n<li><code>[:blank:]</code> is only horizontal white space: spaces and tabs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can combine these freely with other characters in a character class. Thus, <code>[[:blank:]]</code> will match a single space or tab character, while <code>[[:space:],;]</code> will match any whitespace character at all as well as comma and semicolon.</p>\n<p>Often, you would want to match a <em>sequence</em> of whitespace characters, not just a single one. Otherwise, you will miscount words; <code>the  other  one</code> has four spaces, but there are only three words.</p>\n<p>To match a sequence, use the &quot;one or more repetitions&quot; operator, <code>+</code>: <code>[[:space:]]+</code>. This is also more efficient. And it doesn't stop you from counting characters as well, because in the action the variable <code>yyleng</code> is the number of characters matched by the pattern.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"http://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Patterns.html#Patterns\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Flex manual</a>.</p>\n"}], "is_answered": true, "answer_count": 2, "last_activity_date": 1622219509, "question_id": 67738350, "title": "What is the regular expression for matching white space among words in a sentence for FLEX?", "body": "<p>I want to first match the white spaces among words then want to count total number of white spaces in a sentence.
