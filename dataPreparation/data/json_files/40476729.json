However, django-pyodbc appears to be coded specifically for Microsoft SQL Server, and the SQL dialects for SQL Server (\"T-SQL\") and Access (\"Access SQL\") are similar but not identical, so compatibility with Access SQL may be somewhat limited.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the question remains as to whether it is a <em>good idea</em> to use an Access database as a back-end for a Django application. The answer to that question is \"Probably not.\". An Access database is generally not a good choice of back-end for a web application. In fact, <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj653753.aspx#access_database\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Microsoft strongly recommends against using Access in web applications</a>.</p>\n"}], "is_answered": true, "answer_count": 1, "score": 5, "last_activity_date": 1572603479, "creation_date": 1478562828, "question_id": 40476729, "title": "Is it possible to use Django with an Access database?", "body": "<p>Is it possible to use a Microsoft Access database (.accdb) as the back-end for a Django application?</p>\n"}
